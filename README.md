# Odin Landing Page Project

This is my attempt at doing The Odin Project's second project, which asks the student to recreate the layout of the web page shown in [this image](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png).

For now I have only recreated the layout, but I am going to change the placeholder texts and images and also play with the fonts and colors.
